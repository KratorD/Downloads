Downloads
===========

Upgrade of original Downloads module for Zikula 1.3.x with **significantly** 
reduced functionality.

Really, this work is only intended as a 'bridge' to allow sites currently using Downloads to quickly upgrade to Zikula 1.3 while we all await the monolithic 'EMR' module that will replace all things media related.

This will only have basic functionality including:
  - upgrade from v2.4 (with conversion to 'Categories')
  - admin (only) creation of new entries including upload of files
  - user view with filter by category

This is a 'blind' rewrite with no actual base in the old code. It just begins with the data and seeks to manage it with the new tools available in Zikula 1.3.x
