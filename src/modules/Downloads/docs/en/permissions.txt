Downloads Permissions
=====================

There remain three types of permissions available in Downloads.

General:
--------
  - Users need 'READ' access in order to view the user interface to Downloads.
  - Default settings in Zikula give users 'COMMENT' access which is higher, so
    by default, all users can access all downloads.
  - To deny groups access to the entire module do:
    <groupname> | Downloads:: | .* | Overview Access (or no access)

Item Specific:
--------------
  - By default all users have access to all downloads.
  - To deny a group access to a specific item do:
    <groupname> | Downloads::Item | ID#:: | No Access (replace ID# with integer value of download lid)

Category Specific:
------------------
  - By default all users have access to all categories.
  - to deny a group access to a specific category do:
    <groupname> | Downloads::Category | ID#:: | No Access (replace ID# with integet value of category cid)
  - IMPORTANT NOTE: denying access to a parent category DOES NOT deny access to
    it's children! The permissions system is not aware of the tree structure!


Notes:
------
The following components were listed as available in Downloads 2.4 and are no longer available.
  - Downloads::Add
  - Downloads::Modify

In version 3.0.0 of Downloads only Admins have permission to add downloads.
